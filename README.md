You'll also need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) or some kind of web wallet enabled to sign transactions in the browser.

Git clone this repo.

git clone https://github.com/1Hive/transactions-app.git
```

Navigate into the `transactions-app` directory.

```sh
cd transactions-app
```

Install npm dependencies.

Deploy a dao with Token Manager and Voting apps installed on your local environment.

```sh
npm run start:ipfs:template
```

## How to deploy to an organization

Transactions app are published to APM on Mainnet and Rinkeby at `transactions.open.aragonpm.eth`

To deploy to an Aragon DAO you can use the [Aragon CLI](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/cli-intro.html), and follow these steps.

```
# setup your environment
env="--environment aragon:mainnet --ipfs-rpc https://ipfs.eth.aragon.network/ipfs/"

# set a variable for your DAO
dao=<your_dao_address>

# set a variable for the voting app
voting=0x35b74057a93280eb57f9863298f6a6908b38898a

# install the app to the DAO
aragon dao install $dao transactions.open.aragonpm.eth $env

# go to https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/<your-dao-address>/<your-voting-app-address>
# and vote on the installation 

# check the DAO to get the proxy address of the new app
dao apps $dao --all $env

# set a variable for the address of the proxy of the new app
app=<transactions_app_proxy_address_goes_here>

# we need to set up any permission for the app to wire it into the DAO
# (this makes it show up in the UI).
# Note: We assign to $voting the app's DUMMY_ROLE and set up

aragon dao acl create $dao $app DUMMY_ROLE $voting $voting $env

# go back again to https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/<your-dao-address>/<your-voting-app-address>
# and vote on the permission assignation. When it's done, you will see the Transactions
# app appear in the apps' sidebar.

```
